 Project Overview

Professional network security assessment conducted on a home network infrastructure, identifying 4 critical vulnerabilities including a confirmed CVE (CVE-2007-6750) and default credential usage.

 Key Achievements

-  4 Critical Security Findings** identified and documented
-  1 Confirmed CVE** (CVE-2007-6750) - Slowloris DoS vulnerability
-  Default Credentials** discovered and validated
-  Professional Security Report** with risk ratings and remediation
-  Complete Methodology** documented with reproducible steps

 Tools & Technologies

- Nmap 7.97** - Network discovery and vulnerability scanning
- Manual Testing** - Credential validation and service analysis
- Risk Assessment** - CVSS scoring and impact analysis
- Professional Reporting** - Structured security documentation

 Methodology

1. **Network Discovery** - Identified active hosts using network scanning
2. **Service Enumeration** - Discovered running services and versions  
3. **Vulnerability Assessment** - Tested for known security weaknesses
4. **Authentication Testing** - Validated credential security
5. **Risk Analysis** - Assessed impact and likelihood of exploitation

  Critical Findings

 1. Default Administrative Credentials (CVSS: 9.8)
- Impact:** Complete network compromise
- Evidence:** Successful authentication with admin/admin
- Recommendation:** Immediate password change required

 2. Unencrypted Administrative Access - Telnet (CVSS: 9.1)
- Impact:** Credential interception via network monitoring
- Evidence:** Port 23 exposed with admin interface
- Recommendation:** Disable Telnet, use SSH with key authentication

 3. Unnecessary Administrative Services (CVSS: 7.8)
- Impact:** Increased attack surface
- Evidence:** FTP (21) and SSH (22) services exposed
- Recommendation:** Disable unused services

 4. Denial of Service Vulnerability - CVE-2007-6750 (CVSS: 7.5)
- Impact:** Network service disruption
- Evidence:** Slowloris vulnerability confirmed
- Recommendation:** Firmware update and rate limiting
