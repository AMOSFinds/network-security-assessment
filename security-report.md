## Detailed Findings

### **CRITICAL FINDING 1: Default Administrative Credentials**
**Risk Level:** CRITICAL  
**CVSS Score:** 9.8  
**Affected Asset:** D-Link Router (10.0.0.2)

**Description:**
The network gateway device is configured with default administrative credentials (admin/admin), allowing unrestricted administrative access to any user on the network.

**Impact:**
- Complete network compromise
- Unauthorized configuration changes
- Traffic interception and manipulation
- Network service disruption

**Evidence:**
- Successful authentication with default credentials
- Full administrative interface access achieved
- No account lockout or complexity requirements observed

**Recommendation:**
- **IMMEDIATE:** Change default credentials to complex password
- Implement account lockout policies
- Enable two-factor authentication if available

---

### **CRITICAL FINDING 2: Unencrypted Administrative Access (Telnet)**
**Risk Level:** CRITICAL  
**CVSS Score:** 9.1  
**Affected Asset:** D-Link Router (10.0.0.2)  
**Port:** 23/TCP

**Description:**
The router exposes administrative access via Telnet (port 23), which transmits all authentication credentials and administrative commands in plain text.

**Impact:**
- Credential interception via network monitoring
- Administrative command interception
- Complete network device compromise
- Man-in-the-middle attacks

**Evidence:**
```
PORT    STATE SERVICE
23/tcp  open  telnet
```
- Telnet banner reveals: "welcome to D-Link ams_cli system"
- Administrative interface accessible without encryption

**Recommendation:**
- **IMMEDIATE:** Disable Telnet service
- Use SSH for administrative access if remote management required
- Implement network segmentation for management traffic

---

### **CRITICAL FINDING 3: Unnecessary Administrative Services**
**Risk Level:** HIGH  
**CVSS Score:** 7.8  
**Affected Asset:** D-Link Router (10.0.0.2)  
**Ports:** 21/TCP (FTP), 22/TCP (SSH)

**Description:**
The router exposes FTP and SSH services that are not typically required for home network operation, expanding the attack surface unnecessarily.

**Impact:**
- Increased attack surface
- Potential for service-specific exploits
- Unauthorized file access (FTP)
- Remote shell access (SSH)

**Evidence:**
```
PORT    STATE SERVICE  VERSION
21/tcp  open  ftp      vsftpd 3.0.2
22/tcp  open  ssh      Dropbear sshd 2014.63
```

**Recommendation:**
- Disable FTP service if not required
- Disable SSH if remote management not needed
- If SSH required, implement key-based authentication
- Change default SSH port

---

### **CRITICAL FINDING 4: Denial of Service Vulnerability**
**Risk Level:** HIGH  
**CVSS Score:** 7.5  
**Affected Asset:** D-Link Router (10.0.0.2)  
**CVE:** CVE-2007-6750

**Description:**
The router's web server is vulnerable to Slowloris denial-of-service attacks, which can render the device unresponsive and disrupt network services.

**Impact:**
- Network service disruption
- Administrative interface unavailability
- Potential internet connectivity loss
- Easy exploitation with minimal resources

**Evidence:**
```
http-slowloris-check:
  VULNERABLE:
  Slowloris DOS attack
    State: LIKELY VULNERABLE
    IDs:  CVE:CVE-2007-6750
```

**Recommendation:**
- **IMMEDIATE:** Update firmware to latest version
- Implement rate limiting if available
- Consider web server timeout configurations
- Monitor for unusual connection patterns

## Risk Assessment Matrix

| Finding | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Level |
|---------|------------|---------|------------|
| Default Credentials | Very High | Critical | **CRITICAL** |
